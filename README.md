# Basic CRUD Full Stack Project

Welcome to the **Basic CRUD Full Stack Project** repository! This project demonstrates a basic full stack application with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using Angular and Angular Material for the front end and JSON Server as the backend API and database.

***

## About

This project is designed to showcase a simple but effective full stack web application. It uses Angular framework with Angular Material components to create a modern, responsive user interface, while JSON Server acts as a quick mock backend providing RESTful API endpoints. The app performs all core CRUD operations including adding, reading, editing, and deleting data items.

It serves as an excellent starter template for developers looking to build full stack applications with Angular and mock backends quickly.

***

## Features

- Clean and responsive Angular frontend using Angular Material design library.
- Interaction with a JSON Server backend simulating a REST API.
- Full CRUD operations:
  - Create new records
  - Read and display records
  - Update existing records
  - Delete records
- Modular and maintainable code structure.
- Local JSON file used as database via JSON Server.

***

## Technologies Used

- Frontend:
  - Angular (with Angular CLI)
  - Angular Material UI components
- Backend:
  - JSON Server (mock REST API)
- Others:
  - TypeScript, HTML, CSS
